# Dot-Visual

#### Dot-Visual
Dot-Visual is a Python script that allows you to create UI designs using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. You can use the GUI to drag and drop widgets onto a canvas and arrange them to create your design. The script will then generate code for the UI based on your design.

## Installation
To use Dot-Visual, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can download the Dot-Visual script from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/diwash-karki/Dot-Visual

## Usage
To use Dot-Visual, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script and run the following command:

## Copy code
python main.py
This will launch the Dot-Visual GUI. From there, you can use the toolbar on the left to select widgets and drag them onto the canvas. You can also use the mouse to resize and move widgets around the canvas.

Once you're happy with your design, click the "Generate Code" button to generate Python code for the UI. You can then copy this code and paste it into your own Python project.

Dot-Visual also includes a number of features to make your workflow more efficient. For example, the script will automatically save your project and open it from the last saved data the next time you launch the GUI.
